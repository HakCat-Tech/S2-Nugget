# S2-Nugget
##Repo for the esp32s2 version of the Wi-Fi Nugget
Welcome to the Github repo for the S2 Nugget! The S2 Nugget is a Wi-Fi Nugget breakout board combined with an ESP32S2 based S2 Mini development board.

Because the S2 Mini is pin-compadible with the D1 Mini, the origional Wi-Fi Nugget breakout board can be used to make an S2 Nugget by swapping out the D1 mini for an S2 mini.

The ESP32s2 has many advantages over the ESP8266 used in the origional Wi-Fi Nugget, such as:
1) USB support, allowing you to drag and drop code to a flash drive
2) HID support, allowing you to do USB rubber ducky style attacks
3) Wi-Fi monitor mode in Python
4) Support for CircuitPython
