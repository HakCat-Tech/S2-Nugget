# S2-Nugget
## Repo for the esp32s2 version of the Wi-Fi Nugget
Welcome to the Github repo for the S2 Nugget! The S2 Nugget is a Wi-Fi Nugget breakout board combined with an ESP32S2 based S2 Mini development board.

Because the S2 Mini is pin-compadible with the D1 Mini, the origional Wi-Fi Nugget breakout board can be used to make an S2 Nugget by swapping out the D1 mini for an S2 mini.

You can learn more about the ESP32s2 here: https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2
You can learn about the S2 Mini development board here: https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html

The ESP32s2 has many advantages over the ESP8266 used in the origional Wi-Fi Nugget, such as:
1) USB support, allowing you to drag and drop code to a flash drive
2) HID support, allowing you to do USB rubber ducky style attacks
3) Wi-Fi monitor mode in Python
4) Support for CircuitPython
